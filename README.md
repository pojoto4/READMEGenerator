## Description

 This is a command-line application that prompts users to give information about their project. They are asked a series of questions and once submitted, it automatically creates a formatted document for them to add to their profile. This makes it much easier for them to create READMEs because the most time-consuming part is taken out.

## Installation

 You have to make sure you have the correct folders installed like node modules and also install the inquirer package so that the application can launch properly. Once you put node index.js into your terminal, it will launch and prompt you to fill out the README.

## Usage

 Once the app launches in your terminal, fill out all the required info when prompted and explain the use of your project and why you made it.

## Contributing
